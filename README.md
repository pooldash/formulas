## To use it

First, clone this repository and cd into it.

`npm install`\
`npm run pd`

Then, edit (and save!) the `edit_me.ts` file to include your own pool's information & readings. When you're through, run this again:
`npm run pd`

## To explore

More docs coming soon, check out the treatment functions for more fun in the meantime

## To test

`npm run test`
The treatment functions should have exhaustive unit tests (eventually).
